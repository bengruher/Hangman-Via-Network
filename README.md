# Hangman-Via-Network
Project assigned in CPSC 3500 Computer Networks. This was my first experience with programming over the network. We used to sockets to send TCP/IP packets between the client and the server. Online leaderboard was displayed to the client. Score is calculated as follows: number of guesses divided by the length of the word (lower score is better).
